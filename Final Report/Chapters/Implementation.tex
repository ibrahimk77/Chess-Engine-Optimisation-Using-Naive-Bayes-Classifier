\chapter{Implementation}


\section{Introduction}
The implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier in the chess engine was done in Python. The implementation was done in two parts. The first part was to implement the Naive Bayes classifier and the second part was to implement the classifier in the chess engine. The implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier was done using the scikit-learn library. The implementation of the classifier in the chess engine was done using the python-chess library.
